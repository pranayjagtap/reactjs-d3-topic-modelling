from the 90 mn of the psychotronic man you easily have 30 mn of driving through the countryside with annoying bad country music br br that leaves say 60 mn of pure movie pure indeed br br this is not a movie this is not an essay about a movie this does not bear any resemblance with art or cheesy fun or anything connected with the movie business br br there are some movies which are so bad you can find them amusing fun easy to follow because of their badness well fascinating stuff the only fascinating thing here is the will of the director to show us how good the psychotronic man is at driving a car he is definitely he's the best to lead you on the way to total boredom br br this is probably one of the only movie in all movie history where a blank screen can be a better spectacle
