this film was extremely well acted and cast but the story is what i really enjoyed many people are commenting on the reincarnation aspect of the film they've totally missed the point the film isn't about reincarnation it's about how credulousness and emotional fragility leads one woman into a dark disturbing relationship with a lonely prankster and ultimately about how one woman gets her revenge for a long-ago wrong br br the film is beautifully made with a soundtrack that sets the mood instead of cu-ing you on how you are supposed to react to a scene like so many soundtracks try to do these days br br if you like movies that explore the darker side of humanity then you will really enjoy birth
