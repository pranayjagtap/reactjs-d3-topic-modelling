mike jitlov is a lovable genius of animation the wizard of speed and time with its silly humor fun special effects and really catchy theme song is worth seeing once if you have a short attention span and several times if you root for the little guy br br wizard makes fun of the film industry's obnoxious red tape and the heartlessness of money-grubbing studio executives while highlighting the generous spirit of friends and of directors who want what's good for a film but have their hands tied by the stuffy studio br br the grand finale of this film is worth sitting through some very slow parts for those who have this movie on video or dvd i suggest using the slow-motion option to read some of the cute subliminal messages found throughout the finale
