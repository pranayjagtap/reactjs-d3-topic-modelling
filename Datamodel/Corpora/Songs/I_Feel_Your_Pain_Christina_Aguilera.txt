when i think of you i need you when i dream of you at night i just hold my head up high when i see you in the stars and i sit with you at night i will hold you in my arms and never let go chorus you and i forever forever in mane forever in the sky even in the rain we will last forever i will not forget i feel your pain when you come to my house and we talk and talk and talk i will cherish every word when we walk at night in the park i will always mark every spot you stepped on chorus you and i forever forever in mane forever in the sky and even in the rain we will last forever i will not forget i feel your pain remember i feel your pain
