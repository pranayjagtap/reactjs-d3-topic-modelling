if a picture paints a thousand words then why can't i paint you the words will never show the you i've come to know if a face could launch a thousand ships then where am i to go there's no one home but you you're all that's left me too and when my love for life is running dry you'll come and pour yourself on me if a man could be two places at one time i'd be with you tomorrow and today beside you all the way if the world should start revolving spinning slowly down to die i'd spend the end with you and when the world was through then one by one the stars would all go out then you and i would simply fly away
