come baby find me come baby remind me of where i once begun come baby show me show me you know me tell me you're the one i could be learning you could be yearning to see behind the closed door but i will always be emotionally yours come baby rock me come baby locl me into the shadows of your heart come baby teach me come baby reach me let the music start i could be dreaming but i keep believing you're the one i'm living for and i will always be emotionally yours it's like my whole life never happened when i see you it's if i never had a thought i know this dream it might be crazy but it's the only one i got okay come baby shake me come baby take me i would be satisfied come baby hold me come baby help me my arms are open wide i could be unraveling wherever i'm traveling even to foreign shores but i will always be emotionally yours
