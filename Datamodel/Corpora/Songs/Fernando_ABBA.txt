can you hear the drums fernando i remember long ago another starry night like this in the firelight fernando you were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar i could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar they were closer now fernando every hour every minute seemed to last eternally i was so afraid fernando we were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die and i'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry there was something in the air that night the stars were bright fernando they were shining there for you and me for liberty fernando though i never thought that we could lose there's no regret if i had to do the same again i would my friend fernando if i had to do the same again i would my friend fernando now we're old and grey fernando and since many years i haven't seen a rifle in your hand can you hear the drums fernando do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the rio grande i can see it in your eyes how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land repeat x2 there was something in the air that night the stars were bright fernando they were shining there for you and me for liberty fernando though i never thought that we could lose there's no regret if i had to do the same again i would my friend fernando yes if i had to do the same again i would my friend fernando
