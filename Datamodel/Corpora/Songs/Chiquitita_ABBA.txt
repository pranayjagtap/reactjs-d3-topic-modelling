chiquitita tell me what's wrong you're enchained by your own sorrow in your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow how i hate to see you like this there is no way you can deny it i can see that you're oh so sad so quiet chiquitita tell me the truth i'm a shoulder you can cry on your best friend i'm the one you must rely on you were always sure of yourself now i see you've broken a feather i hope we can patch it up together chiquitita you and i know how the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving you'll be dancing once again and the pain will end you will have no time for grieving chiquitita you and i cry but the sun is still in the sky and shining above you let me hear you sing once more like you did before sing a new song chiquitita try once more like you did before sing a new song chiquitita so the walls came tumbling down and your love's a blown out candle all is gone and it seems too hard to handle chiquitita tell me the truth there is no way you can deny it i see that you're oh so sad so quiet chiquitita you and i know how the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving you'll be dancing once again and the pain will end you will have no time for grieving chiquitita you and i cry but the sun is still in the sky and shining above you let me hear you sing once more like you did before sing a new song chiquitita try once more like you did before sing a new song chiquitita try once more like you did before sing a new song chiquitita
