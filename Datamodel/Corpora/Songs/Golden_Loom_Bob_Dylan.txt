smoky autumn night stars up in the sky i see the sailin boats across the bay go by eucalyptus trees hang above the street and then i turn my head for you're approachin me moonlight on the water fisherman's daughter floatin in to my room with a golden loom first we wash our feet near the immortal shrine and then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine i see the hungry clouds up above your face and then the tears roll down what a bitter taste and then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom with your golden loom i walk across the bridge in the dismal light where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night i see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail and then i kiss your lips as i lift your veil but you're gone and then all i seem to recall is the smell of perfume and your golden loom
