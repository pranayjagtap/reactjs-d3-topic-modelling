here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill birds of passage you and me we fly instinctively when the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun neither you nor i'm to blame when all is said and done in our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex we're still striving for the sky no taste for humble pie thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun neither you nor i'm to blame when all is said and done it's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor how you rise shake your head get up and ask for more clear-headed and open-eyed with nothing left untried standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run there's no hurry any more when all is said and done standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run there's no hurry any more when all is said and done
