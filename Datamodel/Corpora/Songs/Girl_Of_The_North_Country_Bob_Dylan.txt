if you're travelin in the north country fair where the winds hit heavy on the borderline remember me to one who lives there for she once was a true love of mine if you go when the snowflakes storm when the rivers freeze and summer ends please see she has a coat so warm to keep her from the howlin winds please see if her hair hangs long if it rolls and flows all down her breast please see for me if her hair's hanging long for that's the way i remember her best i'm a-wonderin if she remembers me at all many times i've often prayed in the darkness of my night in the brightness of my day so if you're travelin the north country fair where the winds hit heavy on the borderline remember me to one who lives there for she once was a true love of mine
