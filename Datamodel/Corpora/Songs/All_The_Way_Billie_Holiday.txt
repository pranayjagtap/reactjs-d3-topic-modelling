when somebody loves you it's no good unless he loves you all the way happy to be near you when you need someone to cheer you all the way taller than the tallest tree is that's how it's got to feel deeper than the deep blue see is that's how deep it goes if its real when somebody needs you it's no good unless he needs you all the way through the good or lean years and for all the in between years come what may who know where the road will lead us only a fool would say but if you'll let me love you it's for sure i'm gonna love you all the way all the way
