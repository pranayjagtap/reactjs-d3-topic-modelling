there's a tree standing there in such an ordinary way but as i look around everything keeps changing there's a leaf on that tree and it floats into a stream and like everything it gets carried away to the sea chorus but if we give a little of our love away maybe meet in the middle every night and day if we could hear just a whisper of what the heart needs to say it could sure make a difference in some small in some small way in your heart lies the key that unlocks your destiny look within and we'll find everything we're longing for chorus oh may you cherish each moment you live and know all the love that you give will go on and on and on there's a sky vast and blue and it lies deep inside of you breathe it in let it out breathe it in again chorus
