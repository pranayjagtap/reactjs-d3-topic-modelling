half past twelve and i'm watching the late show in my flat all alone how i hate to spend the evening on my own autumn winds blowing outside my window as i look around the room and it makes me so depressed to see the gloom there's not a soul out there no-one to hear my prays gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight won't somebody help me chase the shadows away gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight take me through the darkness to the break of the day movie stars find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win it's so different from the world i'm living in tired of t v i open the window and i gaze into the night but there's nothing there to see no one in sight there's not a soul out there no-one to hear my prays gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight won't somebody help me chase the shadows away gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight take me through the darkness to the break of the day gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight there's not a soul out there no-one to hear my prays gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight won't somebody help me chase the shadows away gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight take me through the darkness to the break of the day gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight won't somebody help me chase the shadows away gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight take me through the darkness to the break of the day
