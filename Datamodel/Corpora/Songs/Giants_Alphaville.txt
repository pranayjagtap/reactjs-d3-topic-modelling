be on your guard when you sit in the open places because i'm blessed with all the wonders of the sun when tigers palmtrees rattlesnakes unfold their graces that kind of magic you may get a sunburn from and there's no better way for us than our old sweet ways and angels burn to dust before the human race we're giants under a rainbow we're stranded east of eden sometimes we're crying in the afterglow in a world of broken toys how can we live without them freedom that is what you are always screaming it is a scream but more a nightmare than a laugh those without faith are liars even when they're dreaming i'd put my faith in god if he knew how to dance but there's no devil in the darkness no demon in the skies nothing to be afraid of cross my heart and hope to die freedom freedom
