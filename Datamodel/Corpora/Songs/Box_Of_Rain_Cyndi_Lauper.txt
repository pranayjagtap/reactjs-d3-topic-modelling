look out of any window any morning any evening any day maybe the sun is shining birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky what do you want me to do to do for you to see you through this is all a dream we dreamed one afternoon long ago walk out of any doorway feel your way feel your way like the day before maybe you'll find direction around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you what do you want me to do to watch for you while you're sleeping well please don't be surprised when you find me dreaming too look into any eyes you find by you you can see clear through to another day i know it's been seen before through other eyes on other days while going home what do you want me to do to do for you to see you through it's all a dream we dreamed one afternoon long ago walk into splintered sunlight inch your way through dead dreams to another land maybe you're tired and broken your tongue is twisted with words half spoken and thoughts unclear what do you want me to do to do for you to see you through a a box of rain will ease the pain and love will see you through just a box of rain wind and water believe it if you need it if you don't just pass it on sun and shower wind and rain in and out the window like a moth before a flame it's just a box of rain i don't know who put it there believe it if you need it or leave it if you dare but it's just a box of rain or a ribbon for your hair such a long long time to be gone and a short time to be there
