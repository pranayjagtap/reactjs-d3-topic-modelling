i wasn't jealous before we met now every woman i see is a potential threat and i'm possessive it isn't nice you've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice but now it isn't true now everything is new and all i've learned has overturned i beg of you don't go wasting your emotion lay all your love on me it was like shooting a sitting duck a little smalltalk a smile and baby i was stuck i still don't know what you've done with me a grown-up woman should never fall so easily i feel a kind of fear when i don't have you near unsatisfied i skip my pride i beg you dear don't go wasting your emotion lay all your love on me don't go sharing your devotion lay all your love on me i've had a few little love affairs they didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce i used to think that was sensible it makes the truth even more incomprehensible cause everything is new and everything is you and all i've learned has overturned what can i do don't go wasting your emotion lay all your love on me don't go sharing your devotion lay all your love on me
