summer night city summer night city waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark summer night city walking in the moonlight love making in the park summer night city in the sun i feel like sleeping i can't take it for too long my impatience slowly creeping up my spine and going strong i know what's waiting there for me tonight i'm loose and fancy free ah-ah when the night comes with the action i just know it's time to go can't resist the strange attraction from that giant dynamo lots to take and lots to give time to breathe and time to live waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark summer night city walking in the moonlight love making in the park summer night city it's elusive call it glitter somehow something turns me on some folks only see the litter we don't miss them when they're gone i love the feeling in the air my kind of people everywhere ah-ah when the night comes with the action i just know it's time to go can't resist the strange attraction from this giant dynamo and tomorrow when it's dawning and the first birds starts to sing in the pale light of the morning nothing's worth remembering it's a dream it's out of reach scattered driftwood on the beach waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark summer night city walking in the moon light love making in the park summer night city waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark summer night city walking in the moon light love making in the park summer night city waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark summer night city walking in the moon light love making in the park summer night city
