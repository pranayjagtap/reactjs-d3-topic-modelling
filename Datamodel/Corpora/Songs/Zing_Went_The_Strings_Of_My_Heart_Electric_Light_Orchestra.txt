dear when you smile at me i hear a melody it haunted me from the start something inside of me started a symphony zing went the strings of my heart whoa now the breath of spring whoa i heard a robin sing about a nest apart all that you seem to be end up in harmony zing went the strings of my heart i still recall the thrill i guess i always will i hope we'll never depart dear with your lips to mine a rhapsody divine zing went the strings of my heart zing went the strings of my heart zing zing zing zing
