strangers in the night exchanging glances wondering in the night what were the chances we'd be sharing love before the night was through something in your eyes was so inviting something in your smile was so exciting something in my heart told me i must have you strangers in the night two lonely people we were strangers in the night up to the moment when we said our first hello little did we know love was just a glance away a warm embracing dance away and ever since that night we've been together lovers at first sight in love forever it turned out so right for strangers in the night love was just a glance away a warm embracing dance away and ever since that night we've been together lovers at first sight in love forever it turned out so right for strangers in the night
