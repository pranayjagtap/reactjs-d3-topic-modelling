one evening for pleasure i rambled to view the fair fields all alone down by the banks of loch eiron where beauty and pleasure were known i spied a fair maid at her labour which caused me to stay for a while and i thought of a goddess to beauty bloomin bright star of bright isle i humbled myself to her beauty fair maiden where do you belong are you from heaven descended abiding in cupid's fair throne young man i will tell you a secret it's true i'm a maid that is poor and to part from my vows and my promise is more than my heart can endure therefore i remain at my service and go through all my hardship and toil and wait for the lad that has left me all alone on the banks of belle isle young maiden i wish not to banter it's true i come here in disguise i came here to fulfill our last promise and hope to give you a surprise i've known you're a maid i love dearly and you've been in my heart all the while for me there is no other damsel than my bloomin bright star of belle isle
