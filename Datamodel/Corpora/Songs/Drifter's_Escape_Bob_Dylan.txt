oh help me in my weakness i heard the drifter say as they carried him from the courtroom and were taking him away my trip hasn't been a pleasant one and my time it isn't long and i still do not know what it was that i've done wrong well the judge he cast his robe aside a tear came to his eye you fail to understand he said why must you even try outside the crowd was stirring you could hear it from the door inside the judge was stepping down while the jury cried for more oh stop that cursed jury cried the attendant and the nurse the trial was bad enough but this is ten times worse just then a bolt of lightning struck the courthouse out of shape and while ev'rybody knelt to pray the drifter did escape
