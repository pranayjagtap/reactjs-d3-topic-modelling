oh the time will come up when the winds will stop and the breeze will cease to be breathin like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins the hour that the ship comes in and the sea will split and the ships will hit and the sands on the shoreline will be shakin and the tide will pound and the wind will sound and the mornin will be a breakin the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path and the seagulls they'll be a smilin and the rocks on the sand will proudly stand the hour that the ship comes in and the words that are used for to get the ship confused will not be understood as they're spoken for the chains of the sea will have busted in the night and be buried on the bottom of the ocean a song will lift as the mainsail shifts and the boat drifts on to the shoreline and the sun will respect every face on the deck the hour that the ship comes in and then the sands will roll out a carpet of gold for your weary toes to be a touchin and the ship's wise men will remind you once again that the whole wide world is watchin oh the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes and they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin but they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real the hour that the ship comes in then they'll raise their hands sayin we'll meet all your demands but we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered and like pharaoh's tribe they'll be drowned there in the tide and like goliath they'll be conquered
