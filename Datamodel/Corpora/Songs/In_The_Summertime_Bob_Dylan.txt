i was in your presence for an hour or so or was it a day i truly don't know where the sun never set where the trees hung low by that soft and shining sea did you respect me for what i did or what i didn't do or keeping it hid did i lose my mind when i tried to get rid of everything you see in the summertime ah in the summertime in the summertime when you were with me i got the heart and you got the blood we cut through iron and we cut through mud then came the warning that was before the flood that set everybody free fools they made a mock of sin our loyalty they tried to win but you were closer to me than my next of kin when they didn't want to know or see in the summertime ah in the summertime in the summertime when you were with me strangers they meddled in our affairs poverty and shame were theirs but all that suffering was not to be compared with the glory that is to be and i'm still carrying the gift you gave it's a part of me now it's been cherished and saved it'll go with me unto the grave and into eternity in the summertime ah in the summertime in the summertime when you were with me
