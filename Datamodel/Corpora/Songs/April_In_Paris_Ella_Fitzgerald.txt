i never knew the charm of spring i never met it face to face i never knew my heart could sing i never missed a warm embrace till april in paris chestnuts in blossom holiday tables under the trees april in paris this is a feeling that no one can ever reprise i never knew the charm of spring i never met it face to face i never knew my heart could sing i never missed a warm embrace till april in paris whom can i run to what have you done to my heart
