when she said don't waste your words they're just lies i cried she was deaf and she worked on my face until breaking my eyes then said what else you got left it was then that i got up to leave but she said don't forget everybody must give something back for something they get i stood there and hummed i tapped on her drum and asked her how come and she buttoned her boot and straightened her suit then she said don't get cute so i forced my hands in my pockets and felt with my thumbs and gallantly handed her my very last piece of gum she threw me outside i stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked and after finding i'd forgotten my shirt i went back and knocked i waited in the hallway she went to get it and i tried to make sense out of that picture of you in your wheelchair that leaned up against her jamaican rum and when she did come i asked her for some she said no dear i said your words aren't clear you'd better spit out your gum she screamed till her face got so red then she fell on the floor and i covered her up and then thought i'd go look through her drawer and when i was through i filled up my shoe and brought it to you and you you took me in you loved me then you never wasted time and i i never took much i never asked for your crutch and i don't ask for mine
