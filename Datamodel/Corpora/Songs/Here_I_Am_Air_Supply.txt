chorus here i am playing with those memories again and just when i thought time had set me free those thoughts of you keep taunting me holding you a feeling i never outgrew though each and every part of me has tried only you can fill that space inside so there's no sense pretending my heart it's not mending chorus just when i thought i was over you and just when i thought i could stand on my own oh baby those memories come crashing through and i just can't go on without on my own i've tried to make the best of it alone i've done everything i can to ease the pain but only you can stop the rain i just can't live without you i miss everything about you chorus just when i thought i was over you and just when i thought i could stand on my own oh baby those memories come crashing through and i just can't go on without go on without it's just no good without you
