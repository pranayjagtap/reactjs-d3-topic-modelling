cut the skin to the bone fall asleep all alone hear your voice in the dark lose myself in your eyes choke my voice say goodnight as the world falls apart fuck i can't let this kill me let go i need some more time to fix this here's a letter for you but the words get confused and the conversation dies apologize for the past talk some shit take it back are we cursed to this life fuck i can't let this kill me let go i need some more time to fix this problem i need some more time to fix this problem i need some more time to fix this i'm talking to the ceiling my life just lost all meaning do one thing for me tonight i'm dying in this silence the last star left in heaven is falling down to earth and do you still feel the same way do you still feel the same way fuck i can't let this kill me let go i need some more time to fix this problem i need some more time to fix this problem i need some more time to fix this
