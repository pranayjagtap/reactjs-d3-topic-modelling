i hear the ticking of the clock i'm lying here the room's pitch dark i wonder where you are tonight no answer on the telephone and the night goes by so very slow oh i hope that it won't end though alone chorus till now i always got by on my own i never really cared until i met you and now it chills me to the bone how do i get you alone you don't know how long i have wanted to touch your lips and hold you tight,oh you don't know how long i have waited and i was going to tell you tonight but the secret is still my own and my love for you is still unknown alone chorus how do i get you alone how do i get you alone how do i get you alone how do i get you alone alone alone
