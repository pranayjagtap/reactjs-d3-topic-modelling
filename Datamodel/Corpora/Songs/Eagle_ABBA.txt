they came flying from far away now i'm under their spell i love hearing the stories that they tell they've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons they speak strangely but i understand and i dream i'm an eagle and i dream i can spread my wings flying high high i'm a bird in the sky i'm an eagle that rides on the breeze high high what a feeling to fly over mountains and forests and seas and to go anywhere that i please as all good friends we talk all night and we fly wing to wing i have questions and they know everything there's no limit to what i feel we climb higher and higher am i dreaming or is it all real is it true i'm an eagle is it true i can spread my wings flying high high i'm a bird in the sky i'm an eagle i'm an eagle that rides on the breeze high high what a feeling to fly what a feeling over mountains and forests and seas and to go anywhere that i please
