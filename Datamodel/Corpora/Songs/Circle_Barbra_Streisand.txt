some say the walls betweeen us stand so tall they don't see there's just one sun shining on us all i say we each choose roads to call our own but none of us is travelling through this universe alone and this circle just goes on and on it began before us it will be here when we've gone and this circle just goes on and on and on connecting our humanity joining me to you and you to me seasons keep spinning on the wheel of time we stand we fall we struggle up the mountains we must climb different dreams may colour what we see ahead but our lives are strong together on a common thread and this circle circle just goes on and on on and on it began before us it will be here when we've gone and this circle just goes on and on and on connecting our humanity joining me to you and you to me around and round and round and round we go around and round and round we go love and learn and change and grow round and round and round we go and this circle touches everyone as it crosses every boundary underneath the sun and this circle just goes on and on it began before us it will be here when we're gone yes this circle just goes on and on and on someday we will come to see i'm joined to you and you to me
