beyond the horizon behind the sun at the end of the rainbow life has only begun in the long hours of twilight neath the stardust above beyond the horizon it is easy to love my wretched heart's pounding i felt an angel's kiss my memories are drowning in mortal bliss beyond the horizon in the springtime or fall love waits forever for one and for all beyond the horizon across the divide round about midnight we'll be on the same side down in the valley the water runs cold beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul i'm touched with desire what don't i do i'll throw the logs on the fire i'll build my world around you beyond the horizon at the end of the game every step that you take i'm walking the same beyond the horizon the night winds blow the theme of a melody from many moons ago the bells of st mary how sweetly they chime beyond the horizon i found you just in time it's dark and it's dreary i ponder in vain i'm weakened i'm weary my repentance is plain beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea i still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me beyond the horizon neath crimson skies in the soft light of morning i'll follow you with my eyes through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone beyond the horizon right down to the bone it's late in the season never knew never cared whatever the reason someone's life has been spared beyond the horizon the sky is so blue i've got more than a lifetime to live lovin you
