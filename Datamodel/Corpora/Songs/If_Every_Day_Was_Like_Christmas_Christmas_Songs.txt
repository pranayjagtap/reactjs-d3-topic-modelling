i hear the bells saying christmas is near they ring out to tell the world that this is the season of cheer i hear a choir singing sweetly somewhere and a glow fills my heart i'm at peace with the world as the sound of their singing fills the air oh why can't every day be like christmas why can't that feeling go on endlessly for if everyday could be just like christmas what a wonderful world this would be i hear a child telling santa what to bring and the smile upon his tiny face is worth more to me than anything
