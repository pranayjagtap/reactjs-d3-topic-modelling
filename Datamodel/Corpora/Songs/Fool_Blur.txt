sorry but i don't understand the things you say they make no sense at all funny but i think that you mean them all this time don't you i know that you think i'm a fool but couldn't you try to forgive a fool one more time sorry but i'm not really listening i've got my mind on something else if i'm here if i'm here at all i know that you want me to go don't you but it's not as easy as it seems i know that you think i'm not here at all but i'm just as fed up as you i know that you want me to leave i'm amazed at how cold you can be well may my weak and insipid soul grow stronger in your absence
