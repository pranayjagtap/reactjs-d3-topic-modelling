i don't want to talk about the things we've gone through though it's hurting me now it's history i've played all my cards and that's what you've done too nothing more to say no more ace to play the winner takes it all the loser standing small beside the victory that's my destiny i was in your arms thinking i belonged there i figured it made sense building me a fence building me a home thinking i'd be strong there but i was a fool playing by the rules the gods may throw a dice their minds as cold as ice and someone way down here loses someone dear the winner takes it all the loser has to fall it's simple and it's plain why should i complain but tell me does she kiss like i used to kiss you does it feel the same when she calls your name somewhere deep inside you must know i miss you but what can i say rules must be obeyed the judges will decide the likes of me abide spectators of the show always staying low the game is on again a lover or a friend a big thing or a small the winner takes it all i don't want to talk if it makes you feel sad and i understand you've come to shake my hand i apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense no self-confidence but you see the winner takes it all the winner takes it all
