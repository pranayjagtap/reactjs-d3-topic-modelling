they say that these are not the best of times but they're the only times i've ever known and i believe there is a time for meditation in cathedrals of our own now i have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes but i can only stand apart and sympathize for we are always what our situations hand us it's either sadness or euphoria so we'll argue and we'll compromise and realize that nothing's ever changed for all our mutual experience our separate conclusions are the same now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity our reason coexists with our insanity though we choose between reality and madness it's either sadness or euphoria how thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies perhaps we'll help fulfill each other's fantasies and as we stand upon the ledges of our lives with our respective similarities it's either sadness or euphoria
