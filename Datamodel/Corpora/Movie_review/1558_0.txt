i purchased this as an old rental vhs tape from an amazon third party vendor hoping that it would be a gem in the rough more rough than gem that's for sure the two leads provide breathtakingly awful acting there's enough molasses-slow pacing here to make one those lethargic 50's era b-movies seem like an amphetamine commercial directed by tony scott of course that's only when new-wave punk 80's band members aren't blowing each other across the screen blowing up i meant to say blowing each other up br br if you are a cult film fan then all the pain you have to endure with a movie like this is just part of the fun for the rest of us well bring one of those bags the airlines keep in the back of every seat you'll need it for scenes with lines such as that was our first encounter with disco mutants i was sure it wouldn't be our last br br i would only recommend this if you and your friends get high every day and enjoy watching popcorn pop just don't take anything too strange or you may end up gnawing off your own hand
