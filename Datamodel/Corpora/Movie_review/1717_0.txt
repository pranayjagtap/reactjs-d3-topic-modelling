it grows on you but this one really is hard to review br br on the one hand i am not a nicole kidman fan i have only seen a few of her films 3 or 4 but none have impressed i'm pleased to say that this time around i did in fact feel that she had depth of character at times you pity her character anna at other times you are in anguish and sometimes you just want to rip her out of the screen give her a good shake and ask her if she realises she's bordering on jailable offenses br br apart from the surprise attraction to kidman's acting finally there is certainly much to merit this film others have already noted fantastic cinematography and the delectable soundtrack to be clear some visual sequences may well seem programmed plain or predictable but i think not there is a careful blend between frame composition colour very much so colour and animation there is one handicam scene however which stood out for being shaky for no necessary reason when anna walks through the park to meet sean br br the music or lack thereof has been criticised for being sparse but again the empty space is used to dramatic effect when there is music it stands out and it is used well building pulsing and at times co-ercing anxiety in the listener br br casting technical merits to the side we get to a discussion of the characters themselves i have already mentioned the depth of kidman's character anna the boy sean on first reflection appears very droll but on further consideration is actually quite complex and this is probably due more to the plot than the character other characters in the film are also believable even if not always to one's liking hey did someone say true to life in considering the characters this is where the camera-work colour palette costume and makeup all come together to really enhance each player and there are some fascinating visual and social studies of anna clara and joe in particular br br without providing spoilers the plot seems straightforward but certainly can have you reconsidering what you think has happened or might happen next it is because of the plot that i chose the summary line it grows on you and i think that is a good thing interestingly though it is probably the plot that has been criticised the most by those not favouring the film ultimately i feel the script is the film's strongest feature but you need to want to engage with a slowly evolving thought provoking character based storyline many times this genre has failed miserably but in birth it succeeds with a perfect mix of character pace and script which is backed by excellent film making acting and score br br the film has been labeled controversial for a specific scene the scene itself is neither visually explicit nor sexual but it does imply an impropriety that is both offensive to the majority and probably illegal in the real world as opposed to the film set the theme in question appears again in dialogue later in the film br br in conclusion across the board all parts of this film work together to produce quite a challenging and fascinating piece well worth watching but bear in mind the warning of offense mentioned earlier
