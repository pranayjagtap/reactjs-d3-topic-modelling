this is a drama about beliefs and how these can change based on necessity and fear br br at the beginning of the movie the jew husband the always excellent william fichtner doesn't believe in miracles but after his son gets better from a miracle man he changes his mind and begs that same miracle man who has also slept with his wife in the meantime to come and help his son the necessity of his son win the battle with cancer is more important than his own prejudices and fears br br the movie starts a bit slowly then it gets a bit of a more interesting pace but overall it's not a movie that will have you see it again any time soon performances are good photography is not too bad but the pace is slow
